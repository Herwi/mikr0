=== NICE TO HAVE
- Benchmarks (easy to start)
  | Benchmark of HTTP calling component endpoint
  | Benchmark of rendering on the browser (1000x times)
  | Micro-benchmark of files

- Allow specifying entry point (easy)
- Handle errors on CLI when publishing the registry (a lot but easy to start)
- Add preview mode that runs a real registry (doable)
- Add option for registryFallBackUrl on preview mode like OC
- Add option to publish without building (decide which one should be the default) (very easy)

=== AFTER MVP
- Allow multiple versions of a dependency (medium)
- Add auth + user creation (super hard)

=== CUTE LITTLE THINGS
- Improve performance on publishing (too much redundancy) (doable)
- Add "registry" option to component entry so CLI can read from its (complex)
- Bundle superjson on registry (make it an option) (not sure)
- In dev mode floating window that lets you edit params (some work but doable)
