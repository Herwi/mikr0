=== NICE TO HAVE
- Benchmarks (easy to start)
  | Benchmark of HTTP calling component endpoint
  | Benchmark of rendering on the browser (1000x times)
  | Micro-benchmark of files

- Handle errors on CLI when publishing the registry (a lot but easy to start)
- Add preview mode that runs a real registry (doable)
- Add option for registryFallBackUrl on preview mode like OC

=== AFTER MVP
- Allow multiple versions of a dependency (medium)
- Add auth + user creation (super hard)
- Add migration for changes in DB (migrations table + versioning + checks)

=== CUTE LITTLE THINGS
- Improve performance on publishing (too much redundancy) (doable)
- Add "registry" option to component entry so CLI can read from its (complex)
- In dev mode floating window that lets you edit params (some work but doable)
