=== NICE TO HAVE
- Benchmarks
- Allow specifying entry point
- Handle errors on CLI when publishing the registry
- Add preview mode that runs a real registry
- Add option for registryFallBackUrl on preview mode like OC
- Add option to publish without building (decide which one should be the default)

=== AFTER MVP
- Allow multiple versions of a dependency
- Add auth + user creation

=== CUTE LITTLE THINGS
- Improve performance on publishing (too much redundancy)
- Add "registry" option to component entry so CLI can read from it
- Bundle superjson on registry (make it an option)
- In dev mode floating window that lets you edit params
